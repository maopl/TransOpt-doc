FSAF
========================================

Overview
--------

FSAF is a feature-space acquisition function designed to balance exploitation and cross-task information transfer in multi-task Bayesian optimization settings.

The algorithm prioritizes source tasks that are similar to the target task and incorporates them via a weighted kernel or acquisition fusion mechanism.
